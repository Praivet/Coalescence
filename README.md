##About The Project

**COALESCENCE** is a futuristic AI platform landing page built with **React + Vite**. The project showcases a complete multi-page web application with a dark, high-contrast aesthetic — black backgrounds, orange (`#ed6a2d`) accents, and custom typography (`Coolvetica` + `Induction`).

The site presents a fictional next-generation intelligence company with sections covering its AI models, research publications, company history, and future vision.

**Key design principles:**
- Retro-futuristic dark aesthetic
- Parallax scroll effects on the hero section
- Fully responsive layout using Flexbox and CSS Media Queries
- Reusable `Header` and `Footer` components shared across all pages

---

##Pages Overview

### `/` and `/home` — Home
The main landing page. Features a full-screen hero with a tablet mockup and parallax effect, an animated rotating text headline, a spotlight card carousel, a scroll-velocity text strip, a stats section (array of JSON objects rendered dynamically), and an "About" section with company description and navigation CTAs.

### `/ai` — AI
Presents the three core AI models (NEXUS CORE, APEX VISION, SYNAPSE NET) in a card grid rendered from a data array. Includes an animated hero orb, model stats, and a capabilities section with SVG icons.

### `/research` — Research
Lists published research papers filterable by category using interactive tab buttons. Includes a stats banner (papers, researchers, partner universities, citations) and a chronological paper list rendered from a data array.

### `/history` — History
Tells the company story through a vertical CSS timeline rendered from a data array of events. Includes a founding quote section and a two-column narrative layout.

### `/tomorrow` — The Tomorrow
Full-screen hero section with the company vision, a three-pillar philosophy grid, a four-phase product roadmap, and a final CTA section with links to join the team.

##Responsive Design

The layout is fully responsive using **CSS Flexbox**, **CSS Grid**, and **Media Queries**. Breakpoints used:

| Breakpoint | Target |
|------------|--------|
| `max-width: 1400px` | Large desktops |
| `max-width: 1024px` | Tablets landscape |
| `max-width: 768px` | Tablets portrait / large phones |
| `max-width: 480px` | Small phones |

On mobile, multi-column grids collapse to single columns, the visual orb in the About section is hidden, and font sizes are scaled down progressively.
